# XOXO

A tic-tac-toe multiplayer game, with a customizable number of dimensions.

## Why

Learn to use the [Canvas web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) with vanilla JavaScript.

Trying to develop a simple browser game.

Give my group of friends the possibility to play the breathtaking game online.

And to add something more recent to my github profile of course :sunglasses:.

Will update the readme as the project develops
